# Frontend

This web app uses [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) in conjunction with the [Cloudscape](https://cloudscape.design/) component library. Please consult
the respective documentation as you extend the app.

`canary` directory contains the script to test the cloudfront website, please refer
[Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) for making any changes to the script.

## Local Development

Local development requires below pre-requisites.

- [NodeJS v14.x](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites)

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn install` To pull the dependencies defined in the `package.json` of this project

- `yarn start` To run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will
  reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `yarn test` To run the test runner as defined in `jest.config.js`. See Jest documentation for options to configure the testing

- `yarn build` To build the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the
  best performance.

- `yarn eject` to remove the single build dependency from your project, this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!. This
  command will not be useful unless you want to customize the build.
