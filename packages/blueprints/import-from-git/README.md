# Import from git

Use this blueprint to import public Git projects from GitHub, Bitbucket or similar providers. This is a one-time copy and will not preserve your
_.git_ commit history. The maximum repository size to import using this blueprint is 200 MB.

## Importing Large Repositories

To use a repository larger than 200 MB on Quokka.Codes, you will need to create an empty project and link that repository in the Source Repository
section of the project. For more information on linking a source repository see the _Linking a Source Repository_ section of the _Quokka.Codes User
Guide_

Happy building!
