 * This is the 'Options' interface. The 'Options' interface is interpreted by the wizard to dynamically generate a selection UI.

 * 2. This is how you control the fields that show up on a wizard selection panel. Keeping this small leads to a better user experience.
 * 3. You can use JSDOCs and annotations such as: '?', @advanced, @hidden, @display - textarea, etc. to control how the wizard displays certain fields.
 * 4. All required members of 'Options' must be defined in 'defaults.json' to synth your blueprint locally
 * 5. The 'Options' member values defined in 'defaults.json' will be used to populate the wizard selection panel with default values
