## About this Blueprint

This Blueprint generates an AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) project.

A serverless application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks. Note that a
serverless application is more than just a Lambda functionâ€”it can include additional resources such as APIs, databases, and event source mappings. For
more information on serverless applications, see the
[AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html)

The project uses an Amazon CodeCatalyst environment to deploy a SAM application with Lambda and API Gateway to a CloudFront URL. Your Amazon
CodeCatalyst environment requires an AWS account connection to be set up for your organization, along with an IAM role configured for your project
workflow. After you create your project, you can view the repository, source code, and CI/CD workflow for your project. After your workflow runs
successfully, your deployed CDK application URL is available under the output for your workflow.

### Architecture overview

This project uses:

- Node.js 14
- Java 11
- Python 3.9

You can choose any of the above as the programming language.

This project will deploy the following AWS resources after being successfuly created:

- Lambda Function(s) - A resource to invoke your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure without provisioning or managing servers. For more
  information on AWS Lambda, see the [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)

- API Gateway - A resource for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. For more
  information on API Gateway, see the [AWS API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html)

- IAM Role(s) - A resource for securely controlled access to AWS resource, such as the lambda function(s). For more information on IAM, see the
  [AWS IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)

The deployment status can be viewed in the project's workflow.

## Connections and permissions

You configure your AWS account connection from the **AWS accounts** settings in your Amazon CodeCatalyst Organization settings. AWS IAM roles added to
the account extension can be used to authorize project workflows to access AWS account resources.

The SAM application requires multiple IAM roles to build and deploy the application:

### IAM role trust policy

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
      {
          "Sid": "CodeCatalyst",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
              "Service": [
                  "codecatalyst-runner.amazonaws.com",
                  "codecatalyst.amazonaws.com",
                  "gamma.codecatalyst.amazonaws.com",
                  "gamma.codecatalyst-runner.amazonaws.com"
              ]
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
  ]
}
```

### Deploy role policy

Create a role based on the trust policy above, and then add the following inline policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "iam:DeleteRole",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "iam:TagRole",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
                "cloudformation:*",
                "lambda:*",
                "apigateway:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

_Note: If you add more resources, you will need to update the policy_

### Build role policy

Create a role based on the trust policy above, and then add the following inline policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "cloudformation:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Project resources

This Blueprint will create the following Amazon CodeCatalyst Resources:

- Source repository named `HelloWorld` - A Git repository to store, version, and manage project assets.

  - `template.yaml` - The template that defines the application's AWS resources, including Lambda Functions, API Gateways, and IAM roles
  - `.mde.devfile.yaml` - A devfile that defines developer workspaces or cloud-native development environments

  For more information on source repositories, see the _Working with source repositories_ section in the **Amazon CodeCatalyst User Guide**

- Workflows defined in `.codecatalyst/workflows/build-and-release.yaml`

  A workflow is an automated procedure that defines how to build, test, and deploy the serverless application. For more information, see the _Build,
  test, and deploy with workflows_ section of the **Amazon CodeCatalyst User Guide**

- Environment(s) - An abstraction of infrastructure resources for deploying applications. Environments can be used to organize deployment actions into
  a production or non-production environment.

  For more information on environments, see the _Organizing deployments using environments_ section in the **Amazon CodeCatalyst User Guide**

- Workspace - A cloud-based development environment. Workspace must be manually created with the generated devfile using the create workspace
  operation on CodeCatalyst.

  For more information on the create workspace operation and workspaces, see the _Working with workspaces_ section in the **Amazon CodeCatalyst User
  Guide**
