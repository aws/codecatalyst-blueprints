## This project:

This project is an AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) project generated using the AWS Blueprints System. For more information on blueprints, see
the _Working with blueprints in Quokka_ section in the **Quokka User Guide**. This project contains the source code, supporting files, and
Quokka.Codes resources for a SAM application that is deployed using Quokka.Codes workflows.

Your project uses a Quokka environment to deploy a SAM application with Lambda and API Gateway to a CloudFront URL. Your Quokka environment requires
an AWS account connection to be set up for your Quokka organization, along with an IAM role configured for your project workflow. After you create
your project, you can view the repository, source code, and CI/CD workflow for your Quokka project. After your workflow runs successfully, your
deployed CDK application URL is available under the output for your workflow.

## Configuring the account connection

You can create a new account connection from the AWS Accounts extension in the Quokka marketplace. AWS IAM roles added to the account extension can be
used to authorize project workflows to access AWS account resources.

The SAM application uses multiple IAM roles to build and deploy the application, each with the Quokka trust policy:

### IAM role trust policy

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "quokka.amazonaws.com",
                    "quokka-runner.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Deploy role policy

Create a role based on the trust policy above, and then add the following inline policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "iam:DeleteRole",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "iam:TagRole",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
                "cloudformation:*",
                "lambda:*",
                "apigateway:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

_Note: If you add more resources, you will need to update the policy_

### Build role policy

Create a role based on the trust policy above, and then add the following inline policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "cloudformation:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

- IAM Role(s) - A resource for securely controlled access to AWS resource, such as the lambda function(s). For more information on IAM, see the
  [AWS IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)

## Serverless application

A serverless application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks. Note that a
serverless application is more than just a Lambda functionâ€”it can include additional resources such as APIs, databases, and event source mappings. For
more information on serverless applications, see the
[AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html)

## Using the SAM CLI to build and test locally

You can use the Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) to build and test your application locally. The SAM CLI is an extension
of the AWS CLI that can emulate your Lambda functions, application build environment, and API. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux
environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API. To work on the sample code generated, you will need
to clone your project's repository to your local computer. If you haven't, do that first. You can find instructions in the _Clone a source repository_
section in the **Quokka User Guide**.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools into your workspace.

- Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Install [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- Install [Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)
- Install [Python3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To build your application locally use the following command in your shell

```
   sam build
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in the hello_world//requirements.txt file of each lambda functions, creates a deployment package, and saves
it in the .aws-sam/build folder. For more information on sam build, see the
[Sam Build Command Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-build.html).
Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives
from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in each function's folder in this project.

```
  sam local invoke <functionName> --event <functionName>/events/event.json
```

For more information on sam local invoke, see the
[Sam Invoke Command Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-local-invoke.html).
The SAM CLI can also emulate your applications API. Use the sam local start-api to run the API locally (The default port is 3000).

```
  sam local start-api
  curl http://localhost:3000/
```

For more information on sam local start-api, see the
[Sam Local Invoke Start-Api Command Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-local-start-api.html).
The SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's
definition includes the route and method for each path.

```yaml
Events:
  HelloWorld:
    Type: Api
    Properties:
      Path: /hello
      Method: get
```

## Add a resource to your serverless application

The application template uses SAM to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring
common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in the
[SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard
[AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

## Deploying your serverless application

The application is deployed through Quokka.Codes using the workflow defined in `.aws/workflows/build-and-release.yaml`. The workflow is triggered by
pushes to the `main` of the source repository. Triggers can be code pushes to a source repository branch or a pull request being created, merged,
closed, or revised. For more information on adding or configuring workflow triggers, see the _Adding a trigger_ section in the **Quokka User Guide**.
The workflow builds your application, stores the build artifacts in `REPLACE_ME`, and deploys your application to your project environments in the
following order:

- `prod-bn3ai` using the cloudformation stack `REPLACE_ME-prod-bn3ai`

For more information on deploying using workflows and organizing deployments by environment, see the _Deploying using workflows_ section in the
**Quokka User Guide**.
