## This project:

This project is a Cloud Development Kit (CDK) Web application project generated using Quokka
blueprints.

Your project uses a Quokka environment to deploy a CDK application with Lambda and API Gateway to a
CloudFront URL. Your Quokka environment requires an AWS account connection to be set up for your
Quokka organization, along with an IAM role configured for your project workflow. After you create
your project, you can view the repository, source code, and CI/CD workflow for your Quokka project.
After your workflow runs successfully, your deployed CDK application URL is available under the
output for your workflow.

## Configuring the account connection

You can create a new account connection from the AWS Accounts extension in the Quokka marketplace.
AWS IAM roles added to the account extension can be used to authorize project workflows to access
AWS account resources. The IAM roles for the Web application require the following permissions:

### Web application IAM permissions:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
               "cloudformation:*",
               "ecr:*",
               "ssm:*",
               "s3:*",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "iam:GetRole",
               "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
               "iam:PutRolePolicy"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
        }
    ]
}
```

The IAM roles also require the Quokka service principals `quokka.amazonaws.com` and
`quokka-runner.amazonaws.com`.

### Web application IAM role trust policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "quokka.amazonaws.com",
                    "quokka-runner.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Project details

This project contains the following files and folders in its source repository:

- .aws/workflows/buildAssets.yaml - The template that defines the project's workflow

- node - Folder containing source code for the back-end Lambda code and cdk constructs

  - src - Folder containing code for the Lambda function and generating cdk constructs

  - test - Folder containinng test code

- react - Folder containing source code for the front-end React application

  - build - Folder containing any build assets

  - public - Folder containing public assets

  - src - Folder containing React code

- .mde.devfile.yaml - A devfile that defines developer workspaces or cloud-native development
  environments.

This project has created the following Quokka.Codes Resources:

- Source repository - A Git repository to store, version, and manage project assets.

For more information on source repositories, see _Working with source repositories_ in the **Quokka
User Guide**

- Workflow - An automated procedure that defines how to build, test, and deploy the web application.

For more information on workflows, see _Build, test, and deploy with workflows_ in the **Quokka User
Guide**

- Environment(s) - An abstraction of infrastructure resources for deploying applications.
  Environments can be used to organize deployment actions into a development, staging, or production
  environment.

For more information on environments, see _Organizing deployments using environments_ in the
**Quokka User Guide**.

- Workspace - A cloud-based development environment. A workspace must be manually created with the
  generated devfile using the create workspace operation on Quokka.Codes.

For more information on the create workspace operation and workspaces, see _Working with workspaces_
in the **Quokka User Guide**.

This project will deploy the following AWS Resources after being successfuly created, the deployment
status can be viewed in the project's workflow:

- S3 - A resource to host your front-end assets on a object storage service offering
  industry-leading scalability, data high-availability, security, and performance

  For more information on S3, see the
  [AWS S3 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)

- Cloudfront - A resource for speeding up distribution of your front-end content, such as .html,
  .css, .js, and image files, to your users

  For more information on Cloudfront, see the
  [AWS Cloudfront Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html)

- API Gateway - A resource for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST,
  HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale

  For more information on API Gateway, see the
  [AWS API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html)

- Lambda Function - A resource to invoke your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure
  without provisioning or managing servers

  For more information on AWS Lambda, see the
  [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)

- IAM role(s) - A resource for securely controlled access to AWS

  For more information on IAM, see the
  [AWS IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)

## Using the CDK CLI and NPM to build and test

You can use the Cloud Development Kit Command Line Interface (CDK CLI) and Node Package Manager
(NPM) to build, test, and deploy your application. To use the CDK CLI and NPM, you will need the
following tools in your workspace.

- Install [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html)
- Install [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

To work on the sample generated code, you will need to clone your project's repository to your local
computer. You can find instructions in the _Clone a source repository_ section in the **Quokka User
Guide**

To build your application locally, use the following command in your shell from your workspace root

```
  npm run build-server

  npm run build-client
```

To view the generated AWS CloudFormation stacks, use the following command in your shell from your
workspace root

```
cd node
cdk synth
```

The CDK CLI will output any assets that it will generate the cdk.out folder. For more information
about Assets, see the [Assets page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/assets.html)

## Deploying your serverless application

The application is deployed through Quokka.Codes using the workflow defined in
.aws/workflows/buildAssets.yaml. The workflow is triggered by pushes to the main branch of the
source repository. Triggers can be code pushes to a source repository branch or a pull request being
created, merged, closed, or revised.

For more information on deploying using workflows and organizing deployments by environment, see the
_Deploying using workflows_ section in the **Quokka User Guide**

## Add a resource to your web application

The application uses CDK to define application resources. AWS CDK is an extension of AWS
CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring application resources such as functions,
triggers, and APIs. To add an application resource, you can define a CDK construct in
node/src/main.ts. For a list of CDK constructs, see the
[AWS CDK Reference Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/).
