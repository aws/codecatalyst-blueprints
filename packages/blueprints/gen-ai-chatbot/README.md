# LLM Chatbot Playground

This blueprint generates a sample chatbot using the Anthropic company's LLM [Claude 2](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2), one of the foundational models provided by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) for generative AI.

### Basic Conversation

### Bot Personalization

Add your own instruction and give external knowledge as URL or files (a.k.a [RAG](./docs/RAG.md)). The bot can be shared among application users.

## 📚 Supported Languages

- English 💬
- 日本語 💬 (ドキュメントは[こちら](./docs/README_ja.md))
- 한국어 💬
- 中文 💬

## 🚀 Super-easy Deployment

- On us-east-1, open [Bedrock Model access](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/modelaccess) > `Manage model access` > Check `Anthropic / Claude`, `Anthropic / Claude Instant` and `Cohere / Embed Multilingual` then `Save changes`.

## Architecture

It's an architecture built on AWS managed services, eliminating the need for infrastructure management. Utilizing Amazon Bedrock, there's no need to communicate with APIs outside of AWS. This enables deploying scalable, reliable, and secure applications.

- [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/): NoSQL database for conversation history storage
- [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) + [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): Backend API endpoint ([AWS Lambda Web Adapter](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/))
- [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/): Used to decouple streaming calls between API Gateway and Bedrock because streaming responses can take over 30 seconds in total, exceeding the limitations of HTTP integration (See [quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/limits.html)).
- [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) + [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/): Frontend application delivery ([React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/))
- [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/): IP address restriction
- [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/): User authentication
- [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/): Managed service to utilize foundational models via APIs. Claude is used for chat response and Cohere for vector embedding
- [Amazon EventBridge Pipes](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pipes/): Receiving event from DynamoDB stream and launching ECS task to embed external knowledge
- [Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/): Run crawling, parsing and embedding tasks. [Cohere Multilingual](https://txt.cohere.com/multilingual/) is the model used for embedding.
- [Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/): Scalable vector store with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) plugin

## Connections and permissions

This blueprint supports the Amazon CodeCatalyst Development Role, which can be created from the [AWS console Codecatalyst management application](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/home#/). When clicking "add IAM role", the first option is to create a CodeCatalyst development role. This role can be used across multiple blueprints.

The other option is creating a blueprint specific IAM role, which can be added to the Amazon CodeCatalyst space by selecting "Add an existing IAM role" from the add IAM role options. The IAM role needs to contain the CodeCatalyst trust policy, as well as the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
      {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "iam:DeleteRole",
            "iam:GetRole",
            "iam:TagRole",
            "iam:CreateRole",
            "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
            "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
            "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
            "cloudformation:*",
            "lambda:*",
            "apigateway:*",
            "ecr:*",
            "ssm:PutParameter",
            "ssm:DeleteParameter",
            "iam:PutRolePolicy",
            "s3:*",
            "ssm:GetParameter",
            "ssm:GetParameters"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
      },
      {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "sts:AssumeRole"
          ],
          "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:iam::*:role/cdk-*"
          ]
      }
  ]
}
```

The IAM roles also require the Amazon CodeCatalyst service principals `codecatalyst.amazonaws.com` and `codecatalyst-runner.amazonaws.com`.

### Required IAM role trust policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "codecatalyst.amazonaws.com",
                    "codecatalyst-runner.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
