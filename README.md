## Set Up

We highly recommend you use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This repo is set up to link
things properly when using VScode. Although plugins also exist for vimlords. Many gitignored files will be invisible in vim and may cause annoying problems. 

#### Prereq:
Install these globally. This is required for various tooling to work properly
```
npm install ts-node -g
npm install webpack -g
npm install nvm -g
npm install yarn -g
brew install jq
```


We recommend adding this to your `~/.bash_profile`

```
blueprints-setup() {
    # sign into the aws account that contains the proper codeartifact repository. Ask the blueprints team for access
    ada credentials update --once --account 721779663932 --role codeartifact-readonly

    # Set NPM config to also be the same repository (needed for some synths to work properly)
    aws codeartifact login --region us-west-2 --tool npm --repository global-templates --domain template --domain-owner 721779663932

    #set the repositories in your workspace
    export NPM_REPO=`aws codeartifact get-repository-endpoint --region us-west-2 --domain template --domain-owner 721779663932 --repository global-templates --format npm | jq -r '.repositoryEndpoint'`
    echo 'NPM_REPO set to: '$NPM_REPO
    export NPM_REPO_AUTH_TOKEN=`aws codeartifact get-authorization-token --region us-west-2 --domain template --domain-owner 721779663932 --query authorizationToken --output text` 

    #disable projen post synthesis
    export PROJEN_DISABLE_POST=1
}
```


## Development

git clone

```
git clone https://github.com/aws/caws-blueprints
```

Run yarn. This will link everything. The first time workspace setup may take a minute or two.

```
cd caws-blueprints
nvm use
source ~/.bash_profile
blueprints-setup
yarn
```

Run a build

```
yarn build
```

You're done!

## Testing Changes

Modify a component
```
cd packages/components/<component>
```

Rebuild the component
```
yarn build
```

To see the changes applied in a blueprint run synth
```
cd packages/blueprints/<blueprint>
yarn blueprint:synth
```
This generates the blueprint in the `synth` folder
```
packages/blueprints/<blueprint>/synth/<timestamp>
```

### Publishing

You must have write access to the 'blueprints' organization in code.aws in order to publish. You'll need to get a `CAWS_COOKIE` and set in in your environment.

```
// paste it into your terminal like so:
export CAWS_COOKIE='session-blhahBlahblahBlah'
// run from the root
yarn blueprints:publish
```
